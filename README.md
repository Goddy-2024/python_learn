iteration
Iterables - strings, lists, tuples
loop variables - 
the loop body is always indented (the indentation determines what statements are exactly in the loop)
at the end of each execution the body of the loop returns to the loop statement to see if there are more items to be executed
the terminating condition of the loop - the condition if no any other item to be processed is left
a loop is used to execude a piece of code more than once
for <loop_var_name> in <sequence>:

sequences can either be strings, lists or tuples but the range function can also be used to generate a sequence to iterate over
loops are not only essential in executing a block of code more than once but also creating a pattern
The anatomy of the accumulation pattern includes:
initializing an “accumulator” variable to an initial value (such as 0 if accumulating a sum)

iterating (e.g., traversing the items in a sequence)

updating the accumulator variable on each iteration (i.e., when processing each item in the sequence)
